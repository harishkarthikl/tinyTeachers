    Now that our model has learned to recognize the three classes, its time for the machine to show us what it has learned.
    </p>
    <p>
    Draw one of the 3 doodles trained the machine on, and show it in the red square.
    Lets see if the machine can recognize the class.
    The class label is shown outside of the red rectangle in blue.
    If you are wondering what the number beside the class is, it is the confidence score. 100 means the machine totally confident in its prediction.
